## Description ðŸ“’
 Website downloader downloads all websites assets and compress then sends it back to the user through socket channel
 

 **Explanation of the various flags:**

 - --mirror â€“ Makes (among other things) the download recursive.
- --convert-links â€“ convert all the links (also to stuff like CSS stylesheets) to relative, so it will be suitable for offline viewing.
- --adjust-extension â€“ Adds suitable extensions to filenames (html or css) depending on their content-type.
- --page-requisites â€“ Download things like CSS style-sheets and images required to properly display the page offline.
- --no-parent â€“ When recursing do not ascend to the parent directory. It useful for restricting the download to only a portion of the site.
